## What is class?

- A class in Python is a blueprint for creating objects.
- It groups together data (called attributes) and methods (functions that operate on the data).

## What is BaseModel?

BaseModel comes from the Pydantic library.

It provides data validation, type checking, and automatic error handling.

When you inherit from BaseModel, you can:

- Easily define structured data.

- Validate the data types.

- Use it with tools like LangChain that expect structured input/output.

## What is Optional[str]?

Optional[str] means: the value can be a string, or it can be None.

It's the same as Union[str, None].
**_‚úÖ Example:_**

```python
name: Optional[str]
```

**_means:_**

‚úÖ "John" is allowed

‚úÖ None is also allowed

‚ùå 123 or True would raise a validation error

## What is Field()?

Field() is used to provide extra metadata or rules for a field in a BaseModel.

It allows you to:

- Set a default value.

- Add a description.

- Apply constraints (like min_length, max_length, etc.)

**_‚úÖ Example:_**

```python
name: Optional[str] = Field(default=None, description="The name of the person")
```

**_means:_**

- default=None ‚Üí means it's optional

- description ‚Üí helpful for documentation or tools like OpenAPI or LangChain

## .with_structured_output(schema=Person)

This wraps the LLM in a special way so that:

It asks the LLM to generate information that matches the Person schema.

Then automatically parses and validates the LLM‚Äôs output into a Person object.

üß† Internally, it:

1. Converts your schema (Person) into a JSON-compatible format (fields, types, etc.).

2. Generates a formatting instruction for the LLM (like ‚Äúrespond with a JSON object with keys: name, lastName, country‚Äù).

3. Parses the LLM‚Äôs output and turns it into a real Python object of type Person.

**_‚úÖ Example:_**
If the LLM outputs something like:

```json
{
  "name": "Sarah",
  "lastName": "Johnson",
  "country": "USA"
}
```

LangChain will automatically convert that into this:

```python

Person(name="Sarah", lastName="Johnson", country="USA")
```

## What is LLMChain?

LLMChain is a chain of LangChain components that:

- Connects to a Large Language Model (LLM). You can use any LLM you like.

- Takes an input and produces an output.

- Can be used to build complex workflows.
